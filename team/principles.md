## Communication:
- The team will use a dedicated Discord channel for coordination, questions, and task reminders.
- Questions should tag relevant members, while general updates can be posted to the whole team.
- Important messages should be acknowledged with reactions to show they have been seen.
- Members are expected to check the channel daily (Monday to Friday). If unavailable for more than a day, they should post a notice to keep the team informed.
- Emergencies: In case of emergency, we have the groupâ€™s collected phone numbers pinned in a slack channel for texting and calling. This channel of communication is meant only for specific and rare cases.
