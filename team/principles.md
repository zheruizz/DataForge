### Communication:
- The team will use a dedicated Discord channel for coordination, questions, and task reminders.
- Questions should tag relevant members, while general updates can be posted to the whole team.
- Important messages should be acknowledged with reactions (like thumbs up) to show they have been seen.
- Members are expected to check the channel daily (Monday to Friday). If unavailable for more than a day, they should post a notice to keep the team informed.
- For emergencies, a separate pinned channel will include phone numbers for urgent texting or calls, reserved only for rare situations.
- Clear and respectful communication is encouraged to maintain a positive and supportive team environment.

### Meetings:
- The team will hold regular stand-ups twice a week to track progress and coordinate tasks.
- Additional specific meetings will be scheduled as needed.
- Members are responsible for attending scheduled meetings.
- Notes will be taken during all meetings to document key decisions, action items, and updates.
- If a member cannot attend a stand-up, they are required to provide updates in the team channel to ensure the team remains informed.

### Work:
- Tasks will be tracked using GitHub issues and assigned based on skills and availability.
- If work is taking longer than expected, members should notify the team so adjustments can be made.
- Members are encouraged to seek help when needed and to proactively offer support to others to ensure the team succeeds collectively.
- Pull requests and issue comments will be used to review work before final submission.
- Roadblocks or conflicts will be addressed openly, with the goal of finding fair and practical solutions together.
