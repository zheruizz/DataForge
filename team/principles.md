The team principles doc is a roughly 1-page doc that covers: expectations of the team members, expectations for communication, roles and responsibilities, work delegation, etc.
The document will cover the entire team including CSC454/2527 students. 
An example can be found [here](https://csc491.dcsil.ca/assignments/a1_example/).

Optionally, team values can also be described. A real-world example of company values can be found [here](https://www.getdbt.com/about-us/values).
